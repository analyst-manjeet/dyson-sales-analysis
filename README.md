# Dyson Sales Analysis

This project is about studying Dyson sales data and making a clear dashboard to see the results.  
I worked on cleaning the raw data in Excel and then used Power BI to make an interactive report.  

## What I Did
- Removed errors and duplicates from the dataset.  
- Used Excel to make pivot tables and do some quick checks.  
- Designed a Power BI dashboard with filters like region, category, and time period.  
- Highlighted top products, revenue trends, and low-performing regions.  

## Tools Used
- Excel  
- Power BI  

## Key Insights
- A few regions are not meeting sales targets.  
- Some products bring most of the revenue while others are weak.  
- Sales patterns change with seasons, showing peak and low months.
